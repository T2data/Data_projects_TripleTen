# Title:
	An Analysis of Superstore Data

# Description: 
	* Review the operations of the superstore’s dataset to find some root causes for returned orders
	* Identify and remove customers with only one order by using a Level of Detail (LOD) calculated field   
          (Calc_Cust_Order_Cnt) and Configure the filter to set the range of value to start from 2 (This will 
          include customers who have 2 or more orders)
	* Identify products with high return rates using different techniques, for example, the Quarterly analysis
          shows that the highest rate of returns typically occurs in the third quarter (Q3).
	* Added insights to the caption area 
	
# Dashboard for Monitoring Returns:
    * Created a low-fidelity mock-up with three variations of sketches(Sketch #3 is the chosen one)
    * Developed a Dashboard template using empty containers to match the chosen mock-up
    * Constructed a story arc for presentation purposes
